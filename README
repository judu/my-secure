Authentication in Play! Framework:

 — Basic username/password auth
 — Google openId auth
 — Allows you to add auth providers and use many of them at the same time
 – Gives to the user the choice between several authentication types
 
Usage:

   Annotate the class that has to be « secured » with @With(Secure.class)

   Create the conf/security.conf file.

Security.conf syntax:

   Import configuration from another module :

      import:modulename

   Define named authentication list:
      
      @name       provider1[(param1:value1,…)][,provider2][,@othernamedlist,…]

   Associate authentication providers to an action or controller:

      controller[.action]     @aname[,aprovider[(opt1:value1)],…]

So, many way to do it : define a named list of providers, use it with one or many controller chains, 
use a named list to define another one, many named list for a controller chain


Example:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   @first               google(domain:first-domain.com),basic          |
|   @second              google(domain:anotherdomain.org)               |
|   import:somemodule                                                   |
|   Application.index    @first,google(domain:second-domain.fr),@second |
|   OtherController      basic,@second                                  |
