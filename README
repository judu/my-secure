Authentication in Play! Framework:

 — Basic username/password auth
 — Google openId auth
 — Allow you to add auth means and use many of them at the same time
 
Usage:

   Annotate the class that has to be « secured » with @With(Secure.class)

   Create the file conf/security.conf.

Security.conf syntax:

   Import configuration from another module :

      import:modulename

   Define named authentication list:
      
      @name       provider1[(param1:value1,…)][,provider2[,@othernamedlist,…]]

   Associate authentication providers to an action or controller:

      controller[.action]     @aname[,aprovider[(opt1:value1)],…]

So, may way to do it : define a named list of providers, use it with one or many controller chains, 
use a named list to define another one, many named list for a controller chain
